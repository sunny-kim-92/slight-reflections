Explore the differences in opening repertoire between top-rated chess players. Games are fetched between the Main Player and Players 2, 3, and 4. You can select moves by clicking directly on the stacked pie chart. You can view the differences, for example, between how Magnus Carlsen responds to the Ruy Lopez against Anish Giri and Ian Neponmiatchi.
