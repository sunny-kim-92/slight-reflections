IR-eligible players on the waiver wire are often slim pickings. The likelihood of these players making a fantasy impact in anything but the deepest formats is minimal. But in leagues that provide roster spots for injured players, IR-eligibility represents a free lottery ticket, unburdened by the opportunity cost forfeited by not rostering a healthy contributor. For those with an open IR spot, it couldn’t hurt to take a stab at these players:

### Derrius Guice (RB - Washington)
An ACL tear last offseason, coupled with a meniscus tear in Week 1 this year, has robbed Guice of a fair shot at displaying the formidable talent he showed during a productive career at LSU. He has virtually no body of work as a professional, but frankly, his college numbers speak for themselves. See how Guice’s numbers compare with those of current NFL workhorse and fellow teammate at LSU, Leonard Fournette:

**2015 Totals and Averages - Derrius Guice and Leonard Fournette**

<GuiceFirstTable />

**2016 Totals and Averages - Derrius Guice and Leonard Fournette**

<GuiceSecondTable />

That 2016 season, during which the starting job rotated between Guice and Leonard when the latter battled through various injuries, provides insight into Washington's hopes for Derrius. That he outgained Fournette in yards per carry by over a full yard both seasons is no small feat. Guice won't be eligible for return until Week 9, and even still the team has not provided a timetable on his recovery. But if he can take the field in earnest this season, the potential is there.

### Jordan Reed (TE - Washington)

The injury history of Jordan Reed reads (forgive me, pun purists) like a novel. Since entering the league in 2013, Reed has never maintained active roster status for a full season. In fact, out of the 96 regular season games the Redskins played since 2013, Reed suited up for just 65 (67.7%) of them. But within his spotty health record lie flashes of success. In 2015, during which Reed scored 11 touchdowns off 87 catches, 114 targets, and 952 receiving yards (all career highs), Reed ended as the 2nd-best TE in PPR (behind Rob Gronkowski) and 3rd-best in Standard (behind Gronkowski and Gary Barnidge(!!)). Excitement for him undoubtedly cooled following an overall poor showing last season, where he finished with career lows in a number of efficiency categories, including receptions per game and catch rate. But it’s hardly a stretch to chalk some of these troubles to the carousel of quarterbacks Reed was forced to contend with. Of the 4 players to start at QB for the Washington last year, two (Alex Smith and Colt McCoy) are now backups, while the other two (Josh Johnson and Mark Sanchez) are no longer in the league.

It remains to be seen whether Dwayne Haskins overtakes Case Keenum as the every-week starter. The early returns of the Haskins experience [were not inspiring](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/redskins-at-giants-final-score-daniel-jones-outlasts-dwayne-haskins-as-giants-defense-comes-alive/), but there’s enough intrigue for Reed to maintain IR-stash status.

### Trent Williams (OT - Washington)

I'm definitely not suggesting you should (or can) pick up an offensive lineman. But Trent Williams and his and potential return plays such a critical factor in the values of both Jordan Reed and Derrius Guice, he deserves a dedicated section.

Much has been made about the ostensibly rising trend of high-profile holdouts. Melvin Gordon (unsuccessful), Ezekiel Elliot ([successful, after a month-long sojourn in Cabo during Cowboys training camp](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2019/08/23/dallas-cowboys-ezekiel-elliott-cabo-holdout-contract/2097188001/)), and Julio Jones (successful, after a holdout so brief it hardly registered on the radar) provided headlines this season. We all remember Le’Veon Bell’s full season boycott last year, especially Bell owners.

But lost in the media shuffle is the last remaining holdout for this season, Washington OT Trent Williams. Make no mistake, his absence is immense. According to Pro Football Focus, Williams has only allowed one sack in the past 2 seasons (23 starts), while [earning an 80+ overall grade in each of the past 6 seasons](https://www.pff.com/news/pro-nfl-offensive-line-rankings-all-32-teams-units-entering-2019?utm_source=PFF+Newsletter&utm_campaign=3609a90333-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_06_28_02_31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ae3f4210bf-3609a90333-191487901)

This is pure speculation, but I think there’s a good chance Williams will suit up for the Redskins at some point this season. Much like Melvin Gordon (and unlike Le’veon Bell last season), Williams has a year remaining on his contract. If he does not return [by Week 10](https://www.cbssports.com/g00/nfl/news/melvin-gordon-ezekiel-elliott-holdouts-two-interesting-twists-to-rbs-refusing-to-report-to-teams/?i10c.ua=1&i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&i10c.dv=22), Williams’s contract will toll, meaning the Redskins can retain control over Williams for another season. He may choose to sit the entire year; by all accounts, he is serious about his next contract ([which may be the last for the 31 year old](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-a-first-hand-look-at-redskins-gm-bruce-allen-handling-a-holdout-as-trent-williams-continues-to-sit/)). But doing so would come at significant short-term cost.

His replacement at left tackle, Donald Penn, has an Overall Grade of 64 from Pro Football Focus, not exceedingly poor, but certainly a downgrade. If Williams returns this season, [the entire Washington offense stands to benefit](https://www.pff.com/news/pro-the-redskins-would-be-wise-to-come-to-terms-with-lt-trent-williams).

### Nick Foles (QB - Jacksonville)

Minshew Mania, I Need You & I Minshew, the Constant Gardner (the personal favorite of yours truly). Gardner Minshew, with his mustache, headband, and his unprecedented success as a 6th-round rookie, has inspired as many fantasy team names and memes as plaudits for his performance filling in for Nick Foles, who suffered a clean collarbone fracture in Week 1.

Again, we’re scraping the barrel here. And when we are, sometimes history is too tantalizing to ignore. Fantasy football veterans will undoubtedly remember Foles’s absolutely bonkers 2013 season, where he passed for 27 touchdowns against 2 interceptions. And who can forget [that legendary record-tying 7 touchdown explosion against the Raiders](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/9922785/nick-foles-philadelphia-eagles-record-day-oakland-raiders)? Minshew, the scrambling, gun-slinging disciple of Mike Leach’s air raid, contrasts sharply with the largely immobile Foles (6.7 rushing yards per game for his career). But if the 8-year veteran and Super Bowl winner returns to the field this season, [which increasingly seems likely](https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/jaguars-qb-controversy-gardner-minshew-nick-foles-01dp6h6b6y36), then I simply cannot see how Foles doesn’t get another shot at the starting job. Nick’s contract [pays him $88 million over 4 seasons, with $50 million guaranteed](https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/03/11/nick-foles-jaguars-contract-four-years-88-million-blake-bortles-nfl-free-agency#targetText=Quarterback%20Nick%20Foles%20has%20agreed,becomes%20official%2C%20according%20to%20Rapoport.). Teams simply do not make that level of financial commitment without providing ample opportunity.

Since 2017, Nick Foles played in 7 full (both started and finished) regular season games. His performance chart is worthy of marvel:

<FolesChart />

The bad news? In 5 of the games, Foles's performance was regrettable.

The good news? In the other 2, Foles produced top-5 finishes.

Foles is inconsistent, but when he hits, he hits big. Gardner Minshew is currently [nursing an injury of his own](https://jaguarswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/03/week-5-injury-report-3-jaguars-sit-out-thursday-including-jalen-ramsey/). If you're tasked with filling at an empty IR spot, why not roll the dice on someone who at least one reporter proclaims is [the greatest Eagles quarterback of all time](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/eagles/greatest-eagles-qb-ever-theres-only-one-answer-and-its-nick-foles)?
