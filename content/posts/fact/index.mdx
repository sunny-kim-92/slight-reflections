As we approach Super Bowl weekend, take a look back at the 2023-2024 NFL season by viewing the FACT ratings for each team. Users can add games to see how the ratings for each team would change.

The FACT rating system utilizes a logit regression against each games' scoring margin to determine the strength of each victory. Notably, the system gives each team a running 'momentum' rating that distinguishes between 'streak-less' runs and consecutive wins-losses. FACT also runs many iterations of the data to ensure convergence.

FACT is the creation of David Rothman, a statistician and founder of the aptly-named Foundation for the Analysis of Competitions and Tournaments (FACT). College football famously used computer polls to help decide which teams would play for the national championship. College football in particular has a great need for a system to rank teams, as many schools compete each year ([858 in 2023](https://www.ncsasports.org/football/colleges#:~:text=Melvin%20University%20(LA)-,How%20many%20college%20football%20teams%20are%20there%3F,Division%203%2C%20NAIA%20and%20NJCAA.)).

FACT was included as a major selector for the NCAA Football Championship starting in 1968. In 2006, the NCAA changed regulations to require computer polls to no longer include margin of victory as part of its calculations. Rothman refused to alter his system, arguing the use of score was necessary, and that any perceived pitfalls of doing so was minimal. Despite his compelling case, Rothman's FACT was dropped by the NCAA in 2007. The inclusion of computer polls has diminished since the founding of the College Football Playoff in 2014. However, the Playoff Committee has stated that computer polls are still taken into consideration during the selection process.
